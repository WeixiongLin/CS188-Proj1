# MPC - Model Predictive Control

This folder contains the implementation of MPC algorithm and the evaluation of it.

The implementation is mainly followed in this paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8463189)

Choose the environment folder and follow the instructions to run everything.
